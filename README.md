# The Old Railway Theatre

The Old Railway Theatre website is designed to give any potential customers a flavour of what it would be like to go and watch a movie there. The site is aimed directly at people who enjoy 'classic' movies, that is to say that the movies played here are not new releases, but instead movies with a cult following.

In order to standout from the mainstream cinemas who offer a similar experience, the Old Railway Theatre also offer some movie themed snacks and treat to accompany the movie experience. Alongside the special snacks there is also the overall astetic of the theatre itself with an old fashioned, gilded ticket collection kiosk.

Users of this website are given the above flavour when they land on the home page. This is then built on when the user goes to the 'Upcoming Movies' page where the user is met with information as to what movies are playing, along with clickable links to trailers that are on YouTube. Again alongside the movie information there is a visual offering of what the 'special' movie themed snack will be, where possible it will be themed to the movie that is playing.
